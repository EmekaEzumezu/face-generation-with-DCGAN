# Face Generation

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, the results of the trained Generator is visualized to show how it performed; the generated samples looked like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
